# Alignment & Context Transfer for Account Migration

This file is a full context and alignment transfer for switching accounts in VS Code, GitHub, and Streamlit Cloud. It is designed to ensure you (Ian) or any trusted collaborator can pick up exactly where you left off, with no loss of project, technical, or personal context.

## 1. Project Status (as of September 25, 2025)

- **Main Project:** Brain 2.0 (Streamlit web app, repo: exkpire/br2app)
- **Current Code:** All features and personalization logic are in `app.py` (Streamlit), with `requirements.txt` for dependencies.
- **Deployment:** App is live (or ready to deploy) on Streamlit Cloud, linked to the GitHub repo.
- **Recent Fixes:** Personalization bug fixed (now checks if personalization is enabled and name is set before using it in greetings/messages).
- **How to Redeploy:**
  1. Make code changes in VS Code.
  2. Commit and push to GitHub (`git add .`, `git commit -m "..."`, `git push`).
  3. Streamlit Cloud auto-redeploys from main branch.
- **Best Practice:** Use the same GitHub account for VS Code, GitHub in browser, and Streamlit Cloud for seamless access and permissions.

## 2. Alignment File (`align.md`) â€” DO NOT DELETE OR OVERWRITE

- This file contains:
  - Personal context, project philosophy, and working style
  - Full backstory, motivators, and project split (Brain 2.0 vs Ian 2.0)
  - Expanded context: ADHD, humor, fatherhood, business philosophy, system-building instincts, and more
- **If you add new context, append to this file. Do not remove or overwrite existing content.**
- **If you are a new AI or human collaborator, read this file in full before making decisions or changes.**

## 3. Migration Instructions

- Log out of VS Code with your current account.
- Log in with the account linked to your GitHub and Streamlit Cloud.
- Clone or pull the `exkpire/br2app` repo.
- Open `align.md` and this transfer file to restore full context.
- Continue work as normal; all project and personal context is preserved.

## 4. Additional Notes

- If you need a recap of the last Copilot session, check the latest commit messages and this file.
- If you encounter any issues with personalization, deployment, or account access, refer to the instructions above.
- For any new features, always update `align.md` with both technical and personal context.

**This file is your safety net for context. Never delete it. Always append, never erase.**
